# XSDLibrary
A open source library tool being built by Braden Foor!
This is currently unfinished and will undergo many changes between now and its official release!
Some of the changes I would like to create are:

  Making this available in multiple languages
  Making an official website to download the release of this product
  Create a Linux and Mac version
  Create a Mobile version
  Create a Web version
  Make all versions capable of being interactive
